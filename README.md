## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to take my newly learned fundamental skills of javascript and apply them to the use of CDN's! 

In this project I used exclusively DayJS and jQuery for my javascript.

## Learning Points

```
$("#currentDay").text(today.format("MMMM DD, YYYY"));
```
While a simple tool; DayJS provides very convenient access to extremely important date/time information vital for many website structures.

```
 if(today.hour() > 9){
    hour9.addClass("past");
  }
  else if (today.hour() < 9){
    hour9.addClass("future");
  }
  else{
    hour9.addClass("present");
  }
```
These conditional statements I wrote gave me a chuckle, at first I over-complicated my thought process on how to go about sorting through each time block and give them the according class. At the end of the day i settled with this simple statement that just compares the current hourblock against a value representative of each text box.

## Expectation vs Reality

Truth be told, I had anticipated this task to be easier than it had panned out. The starter code I received to work on felt like it had a majority of what I needed to meet the acceptance criteria.

The difficulty of this project majorily came from the use of jQuery, as I'm not only new to it, I am also still new to javascript as a whole.

This project while it defied my expectations in terms of its difficulty, still didn't give me too many issues in the long run. I learned I really like working with DayJS for whatever reason too!
